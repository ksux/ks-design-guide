You can use hues, shades and patterns to improve communication and
decision-making.

## Principles

### Accessibility

Donâ€™t rely on color alone to convey information.
Colors that are used need a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 to adhere to
WCAG 2.0 AA criteria 1.4.3.

### Highlight changes

When new content is added to the page (such as form elements or information),
temporarily highlight the background of the changed area of the page using a
transition that fades the color away after a few seconds.

### Reinforce meaning

Associate a single color with objects or states that have similar meanings to
reducce the cognitive load on users. For example, use blue to consistently
indicate an action. Whenever possible, leverage the following color palettes to
reinforce meaning:

Color | Usage
:-- | :--
Blue | Actionable elements, such as links, buttons, select tables.
Teal | Relevant but non-critical information.
Yellow | Warnings or critical changes that suggest future interaction.
Red | Error messages and conditions that block a task from completion.
Green | Success messages to indicate a task was completed.

## Term color palette

Colors are mapped to the seasons to reflect common North-American associations
with weather as follows: brown fall, blue winter, green spring, yellow summer.
This strategy allows for each color to be used for sub terms within a season.
In some cases we have implemented a solution where the color of term is based
on a gradient. Depending on where the term lies, the color can be a shade
lighter or darker. In cases where this logic will not work,
use the colors defined.

## State color palette

While each type of data object will likely have its own label and flow for its
state management, there are five general state groups that are color-coded to
hold consistent meaning across objects. These state groups leverage the message
color palette.
