## Internationalization

Formats should be largely configurable to reflect local preferences,
such as `mm/dd/yyyy` vs. `dd/mm/yyyy`. Some data, though, should be universal.

## Day

All interfaces (e.g. administrative, student, public) wishing to utilize
abbreviations for days of the week use the same notations.

Day | Abbreviation
:-- | :--
Monday | M
Tuesday | Tu
Wednesday | W
Thursday | Th
Friday | F
Saturday | S
Sunday | Su

## Time

Data entry for scheduling information should allow for smart interpretation of
text to parse into the appropriate hour, minute format.

Input | Interpretation
--: | --:
9A | 9:00 am
920A | 9:20 am
1P | 1:00 pm
115P | 1:15 pm
12P | 12:00 pm

## Accounting

Display debits to oneâ€™s account in red and with parentheses. For students,
things they owe are debits. For institution admins the student payments are debits.
