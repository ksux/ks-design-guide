## Clarity and brevity
Strive to be concise with content, while using terminology that helps the
user quickly understand the task at hand. Use bullet points as needed to
highlight key information or steps.

## Tone

Use friendly but professional sentences. Communication with students may
be more informal, but avoid slang.

## Punctuation

Use periods only after complete sentences, and be consistent in the meaning
associated with recurring punctuation.
