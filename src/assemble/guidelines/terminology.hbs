Terminology refers to how words are defined for labels and titles.

## Principles
{{/markdown}}

<dl>
  <dt>Don't be redundant</dt>
  <dd>Avoid using new with Create or Add, as it is redundant.</dd>

  <dt>Be active</dt>
  <dd>Use calls to action (such as, <em>Register Now</em>) for section headers when users are being asked to do something with that content to urge them to take an immediate action. Avoid using the progressive form of the verb. For example, use <em>Edit</em> instead of <em>Editing</em>.</dd>

  <dt>Specify objects with actions</dt>
  <dd>Include the target with action labels to make it clear what the user is about to do, for example, <em>Create Course Offering</em>. However, because a Cancel link is in proximity to a button specifying a specific task and object, it does not need to include the object in its own label (<em>Cancel Course Offering</em>).</dd>

  <dt>Soften headline tone</dt>
  <dd>Use articles in page titles to soften tone and help the reader parse the key words. For example, <em>Create a Course</em>.</dd>
</dl>
