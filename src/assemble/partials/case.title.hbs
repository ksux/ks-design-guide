Capitalize every word except articles (a, an, the),
coordinating conjunctions (and, or),
and [prepositions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_prepositions)
of four or fewer letters,
except when part of a verb phrase, such as *Starting Up the Computer*.
Always capitalize the first and last word, even if it is an article,
a conjunction, or a preposition of four or fewer letters.
