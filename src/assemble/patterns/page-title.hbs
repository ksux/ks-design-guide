## Wording
The page title communicates two tiers of information: view object or task (always required), and its context. The nature of the titles should match the screen types. For example, Inquiry and Portal screen types should have object-based titles; whereas, Maintenance, Transactional, and Lookup screen types should have task-based titles.

### Main page title
This can be worded as either a task or an object to best reflect the user's most likely mental map of the web page content. Note the following:

- When the page is depicted as a task, the title should be written as an action with a clear goal, using simple language.
- When the page is an object, the title should include the information that best identifies the page to the user.
- If there is no object name, but will be when the initial step is completed (such as drafting a course proposal), use the task form until the object can be identified. This gives the user feedback that the system has received input.

### Support page title
Describes the context of use for the current page as an object. Note the following:

- If the page is a task with multiple steps, the support title is used to describe the current sub-tasks, such as *Add Your Contacts*.
- If the page is an object with multiple information parts, or peer views, this title is an object describing that part, such as *Delivery Logistics*.
- If the page is an object with peer views, which are separate views that relate to each other, the support title is an object describing that part, such as *Edit Course*.
